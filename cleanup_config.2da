CONFIGURATION NOTES:
====================

This 2DA defines object lifespan in TICKS (not seconds).
1 Tick = 6 seconds (standard NWN heartbeat)

LIFESPAN CALCULATIONS:
- Remains (30 ticks):         30 × 6 = 180 seconds  = 3 minutes
- LootBags (50 ticks):        50 × 6 = 300 seconds  = 5 minutes
- DroppedItems (100 ticks):   100 × 6 = 600 seconds = 10 minutes
- PlayerCorpse (600 ticks):   600 × 6 = 3600 seconds = 60 minutes (1 hour)

CUSTOMIZATION GUIDE:
====================

To adjust lifespans, modify the LifespanTicks column:

For SHORTER cleanup (faster performance):
- Remains: 20 ticks (2 minutes)
- DroppedItems: 50 ticks (5 minutes)

For LONGER persistence (more forgiving):
- Remains: 50 ticks (5 minutes)
- DroppedItems: 200 ticks (20 minutes)

For HIGH-TRAFFIC servers:
- Reduce all values by 30-50% to prevent area bloat

For LOW-POPULATION servers:
- Increase values by 50-100% for more relaxed cleanup

FORMULA:
Desired Minutes × 10 = LifespanTicks
(because 10 ticks = 1 minute at 6-second heartbeat)

Examples:
- 2.5 minutes = 25 ticks
- 15 minutes = 150 ticks
- 2 hours = 1200 ticks

PERFORMANCE IMPACT:
==================

Lower values = More frequent cleanup = Better performance = Less forgiving
Higher values = Less frequent cleanup = Worse performance = More forgiving

The default values are balanced for a server with 100-300 concurrent players.

For 480+ player servers, consider reducing DroppedItems to 50-75 ticks.
